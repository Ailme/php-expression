PHP Expression Language
=======================

The purpose of this library is to provide a common base for an PHP Expression Language.

This is not really a creative library since it burrows almost all the code from the great
[JMSSecurityExtraBundle](http://jmsyst.com/bundles/JMSSecurityExtraBundle "") which already defines
more or less such a base for a powerful EL (Expression Language).

The idea is to take this code outside of the Johannes's bundle and to standardize it.
